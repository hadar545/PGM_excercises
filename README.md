# PGM_excercises
Bayesian network model, Approximate inference - Loopy belief propagation, Policy learning for RL challenge (Q learning)

Code for all three excercises for the course probabilistic methods in artificial intelligence (Probabilistic graphical models).

PA1:
Implementation of Bayesian Network for exact inference of MNIST digits dataset.

PA2:
Implmentation of Loopy belief propagation (Aprroximate inference algorithm) as an error correcting approach in order to denoise a binary code.

PA3:
Implementaion of 3 agents as a renforcement learning task - teaching a fish to get to its food source:
- Greedy Policy
- Model-based Optimal Policy
- Model-free Policy Learning  - Q learning algorithm
